**Scripts:**

* `convert_all.sh`: converts the svg files in all pbp* subdirectories into png files of the passed size (width=height), using the inkscape command line tool
* `create_problem.py`: python script to combine all scenes of one PBP into a single png file with many options available. Needs the png scene files.
* `create_problem1.1.py`: v1.1 of the create_problem.py script, now ordering the scenes differently and using the last four scenes as test scenes
* `switch_sides.py`: renames the scenes of one PBP so the left and right side are exchanged
* `vacuum_defs.sh`: vacuums the definitions in all svg files in the current and child directories
