Image Files: 
------------

There is one svg file for each scene. The file name pattern is `{row}-{col}.png`.

Each PBP has at least 20 scenes in this order:

    [1,1] [1,2]  |||  [1,3] [1,4]
    [2,1] [2,2]  |||  [2,3] [2,4]
    [3,1] [3,2]  |||  [3,3] [3,4]
    [4,1] [4,2]  |||  [4,3] [4,4]
    [5,1] [5,2]  |||  [5,3] [5,4]

Each row contains scenes similar to each other. Scenes from different rows are dissimilar to each other.

Some of the scenes might be used for training, others for testing.
